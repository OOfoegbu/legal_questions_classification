# CLASSIFICATION OF LEGAL QUESTIONS

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to build a classification model that accepts as input text description of legal questions, and output an appropriate legal category for the question. This model would be helpful in pointing users to the most suited legal speciality for their cases. 

I have made use of data collected from a free source legal site. The dataset consists of descriptions of legal questions from around the united states, the state of the user who posted the question, the date is was answered, and the legal category it was posted under. The legal questions were grouped into 18 legal categories.
